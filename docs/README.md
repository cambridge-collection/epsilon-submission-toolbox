# Epsilon Submission Toolbox

Use this toolbox to decide how to prepare your collection for [Epsilon](http://epsilon.ac.uk).

## I. Get the Toolbox

1. You can obtain a copy of the toolbox by either
   - [downloading and unzipping it](https://github.com/cambridge-collection/epsilon-submission-toolbox/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
   - or by cloning [our repository](https://github.com/cambridge-collection/epsilon-submission-toolbox) using Git.

## II. Choose your submission pathway

1. Decide what you are delivering.
   - Do you only have metadata about the letters or transcriptions in separate word processor or HTML files? Follow the [CSV submission guidelines](https://cambridge-collection.github.io/epsilon-submission-toolbox/csv/docs/README.html).
   - Do you have or want to make transcriptions in TEI and want to submit them according to best practice in the Digital Humanities? Follow the [TEI submission workflow](https://cambridge-collection.github.io/epsilon-submission-toolbox/tei/README.html).
2. Confirm any project requirements with your Epsilon contact (licensing, authority lists, timelines).
3. Work through the detailed guide for the route you chose.

## What each section contains

- `csv/` holds the submission documentation, key template, and sample files you can copy and customise.
- `tei/` gathers the work-in-progress TEI guidance, document templates, and HTML documentation.

## Working tips

- Keep local copies of anything you customise; do not edit the toolbox originals directly.
- Validate your data before packaging.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to the Epsilon editorial team before proceeding.
