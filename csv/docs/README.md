# Epsilon CSV Submission Template

## Instructions

1. Create a folder for your collection at the root level of the toolkit.
2. Create a CSV file containing your correspondence data in the folder you created.
3. Ensure that the first row contains the required, as well as any desired, column names.
4. Enter each letter onto a separate row.
5. Place a copy of `csv/key.csv` in the folder you created. This will be the "key file" for your collection.
6. Supply information about your collection in your key file.
7. If your letters csv has different field names that the recommended Epsilon ones, enter them into the `local_name` column in your key file.

That's it.

## Create a CSV file containing your correspondence data

All records require the following information:
* correspondence details of both the sender and recipient
* date of the letter
* information about where the item currently is (ie. institution and shelfmark or, if it only exists in a printed source (*e.g.* a journal), it’s bibliographical details)

While these details represent the bare minimum required for a useable letter record, many other fields are available (see below).

## Ensure that the first row of the CSV contains column names

If you use Epsilon’s recommended names for the columns, all that remains for you to do is [Supply information about your collection in your key.csv file](#supply-essential-information-in-keycsv).

If any of your column names differ from Epsilon’s recommendation, you will need to provide the information to map your column names onto ours with your key.csv.

For example, if the field name you use for the recipient's address (`recipient_address`) is 'address', scroll to the line for `recipient_address` in key.csv and add the text `address` into the `local_name` cell (Cell D) for that row. 

**N.B:** It’s only necessary to provide mapping information for fields whose names differ. If all but two of your fields match Epsilon’s, you only need to provide mapping information for those two.

You can find a full list of the Epsilon fields and their purpose in [Epsilon Fields](#epsilon-fields).

## Supply essential information in key.csv

In addition to providing you with the ability to map custom field names onto their Epsilon counterparts, the key.csv file also lets you supply default values for each individual field that we support. This value will be used whenever the field is empty (or does not exist) within your CSV.

For example, if you wish to record your name as the contributor of the records, you would scroll to `publicationstmt_contributor` in key.csv and place your name into the `default_val` cell (Cell C).

While you can supply default values for any field, default values make more sense for some fields than others. In fact, there are five fields where it is essential for you to provide a default value, esp if their data is not recorded in your csv.

- `epsilon_collection_name` provides the full name for your collection (*e.g.* The John Doe Collection)
- `epsilon_collection_facet` provide the shortened form of your collection name (*e.g.* John Doe Collection) that’s used in Epsilon’s search forms and browsing facets
- `publicationstmt_contributor` provides the name of the person (or organisation) submitting the record into Epsilon
- `letter_date_min` and `letter_date_max` provide the earliest and latest in which any letters could have been sent. Even if the date of the letter is unknown, you can provide logical values for these fields - *e.g.* your correspondent cannot write a letter before s/he was born or after their death). These values will be used to ensure that any undated letters or letters with an open ended range (‘before DATE’ or ‘after DATE’) sort properly within the entire Epsilon collection.<br/>The value must be provided in `yyyy-mm-dd` format, _e.g._ `2024-04-15`
- If you do not supply unique identifiers for the letters within your collection (DOE-PROJECT1, DOE-PROJECT2, etc) in your correspondence csv, you will need to supply a `default_val` in `doc_id_prefix` (*e.g.* DOE-PROJECT). Epsilon will then create id values for them combining this prefix with the record’s row number in your correspondence csv (not counting the header).

You can find a full list of the Epsilon Fields and their purpose in [Epsilon Fields](#Epsilon-Fields) (*below)*.

| letter_date_sorting          | *REQUIRED* The date of the letter  in `yyyy-mm-dd` format, *e.g.* 1880-11-19. This value will be used when sorting chronologically. This should reflect where you want the letter to appear in a sequence. For example, if you know a letter was written during a particular week, you can assign it a particular day during that week where you would like the letter to appear in a date-sorted set.                                                                                                                         |
| letter_date_text             | *OPTIONAL* A textual form of the date (*e.g.* 19 Nov 1880; 19? Nov 1880; after 18 January 1888; 18-25 Dec 1869)<br/>If this field is empty a textual version of the `letter_date_sorting` value will be created. For example, if `letter_date_sorting` were 1880-11-19, Epsilon would supply a value of 19 Nov 1880.<br/>Strictly speaking, it is only necessary to provide a textual version of the date when it differs from what Epsilon would create, _e.g._ '19? Nov 1880', 'after 18 January 1888', and '18-25 Dec 1869' |
| letter_date_min              | The earliest date for the letter in `yyyy-mm-dd` format, _e.g._ `2024-04-15`. If `letter_date_text` was ’18-25 Dec 1869’, this field would have a value of '1869-12-18'. If it were ‘after 18 January 1888’, `letter_date_min` would be `1888-01-19`.<br/>You *MUST* provide a default value for this field in your key.csv.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
